# Customer-Behavior-Analysis-Project

**Project Overview **
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using transactional data from 3,900 
purchases across various product categories. The goal is to uncover insights into spending 
patterns, customer segments, product preferences, and subscription behavior to guide strategic 
business decisions. 

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
The data was cleaned and prepared for further analysis in python:
1) Imported using pandas.
2) The null values in review rating column were filled by median rating  of each product.
3) Created 2 new columns : age_group and  purchase_frequency_days.
4) Since discount_applied and promo_code_used were same, the later column was dropped.
5) Loaded the data into SQLserver for further analysis.


**Data analysis using SQL queries**
The following business questions were solved using sql queries:
1) What is the total revenue generated by male vs. female customers?
2)  Which customers used a discount but still spent more than the average purchase amount?
3)  Which are the top 5 products with the highest average review rating?
4)  Which are the top 5 products with the highest average review rating?
5)  Do subscribed customers spend more? Compare average spend and total revenue between subscribers and non-subscribers.
6)  Which 5 products have the highest percentage of purchases with discounts applied?
7)  Segment customers into New, Returning, and Loyal based on their total number of previous purchases, and show the count of each segment.
8)  What are the top 3 most purchased products within each category?
9)  Are customers who are repeat buyers (more than 5 previous purchases) also likely to subscribe?
10)  What is the revenue contribution of each age group?
